  description: |
    Uxarray aims to address the geoscience community need for tools that enable standard data analysis techniques to operate directly on unstructured grid data. 
    Uxarray will provide Xarray styled functions to better read in and use unstructured grid datasets that follow standard conventions, including UGRID, SCRIP, 
    Exodus and shapefile formats. This effort is a result of the collaboration between Project Raijin 
    (NCAR and Pennsylvania State University) and the SEATS Project (Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). 
    The Uxarray team welcomes other community members to become part of this collaboration at any level of contribution.
